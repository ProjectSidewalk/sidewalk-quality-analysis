# sidewalk-quality-analysis
In this project, we aim to infer the quality of Project Sidewalk users based on their interactions with our system--both low-level interactions like mouse clicks and moves--as well as higher-level, more application related interactions (amount of panning on a street view image, etc.). More details are in our Dropbox folder `ProjectSidewalk_PredictingUserQuality`

Additional files you will need for the classifier (sidewalk-user-quality-analysis-neil.ipynb):
* `users_one_mission.csv`: CSV of quality information for users with at least one mission
* `sidewalk-seattle-label_point.csv`: Information about labels in Seattle
* `ml-label-correctness-one-mission.csv`: Label correctness for all the labels of users with at least one mission
*  `all_users.csv`: Features generated from the feature generation notebook

If you want to be able to run the classifier from start to finish, use `sidewalk-classification-notebook.ipynb`.

# sidewalk-quality-analysis
An analysis of Project Sidewalk user quality based on interaction logs

Additional files you will need for the classifier (sidewalk-user-quality-analysis-neil.ipynb):
* `users_one_mission.csv`: CSV of quality information for users with at least one mission
* `sidewalk-seattle-label_point.csv`: Information about labels in Seattle
* `ml-label-correctness-one-mission.csv`: Label correctness for all the labels of users with at least one mission
*  `all_users.csv`: Features generated from the feature generation notebook

If you want to be able to run the classifier from start to finish, use `sidewalk-classification-notebook.ipynb`.
